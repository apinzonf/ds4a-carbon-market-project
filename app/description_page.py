There is a high diversity of projects that search to achieve voluntary objectives through the implementation of emission reduction actions in various sectors of the economy, from the forestry sector to public transportation. This diversity of actors and methodologies used bring uncertainty to the companies that buy them, the civil society and the authorities.
        
The carbon markets have been developed in a mainly voluntary way (goals for reducing and offsetting emissions from companies that voluntarily decide to buy carbon credits for corporate social responsibility and to demonstrate some type of commitment to offsetting their emissions), which means that carbon markets are not standardized and those are very different from each other and it is difficult to account for their robustness.
